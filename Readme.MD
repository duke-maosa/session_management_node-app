# Session-Based Authentication in Node.js with express-session

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates how to implement session-based authentication in a Node.js application using `express-session` middleware. Session management is fundamental for maintaining user sessions securely in web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node.js package manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

Install Dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env File:

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=3000
Run the Application:

sh
Copy code
node index.js
Usage
Simulate User Login:

Open a web browser or use tools like cURL or Postman to simulate user login:

sh
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/login
Access Protected Route:

Test the protected route (accessible only when logged in):

sh
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard
Simulate User Logout:

Visit /logout to simulate user logout:

sh
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/logout
Implementation Details
The index.js file contains all the server logic, routes, and authentication implementation.
Environment variables like PORT are loaded from the .env file.
.gitignore ensures that the .env file is not committed to version control.
Security Considerations
Always handle session management securely, especially in production environments.
Use HTTPS to encrypt traffic and prevent eavesdropping.
Securely store session secrets to prevent session hijacking.
Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, you have implemented session-based authentication in your Node.js application using express-session. You can now protect routes and manage user sessions effectively.
